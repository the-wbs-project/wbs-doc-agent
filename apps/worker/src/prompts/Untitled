I want you to add a text box to the upload function UI so that the user can provide some information to the model about the document. It may be instructions, it may be helpful information, just anything that the user wants to tell the model to help the model out. It will not be required, but it's an option. That should be passed to the UI prompts that does the global analysis and also the regional extracts.
