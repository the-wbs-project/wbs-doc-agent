This document does not\ninclude \"Work\" associated with Bidding and\nConstruction Administration (CA).\n\nAs part of the formal University of Minnesota (U of\nMN) review process at each of the major phases\nof design, the Design Professional shall review,\nvalidate and submit the \"Design Deliverables\"\ndocument to the University's Design Project\nManager within Capital Project Management\n(CPM). The inclusion of each required item shall\nbe validated by checking the associated mark on\nthe official submission. The Design Professional\nshall clarify any missing information or omissions.\n\nDeliverables include all items listed in the\napplicable design phase column AND, except as\nspecifically stated, all deliverables listed in the\npreceding design phases.\n\nDeviations to this \"Design Deliverables\" shall be\nreviewed as part of the project team's project\nproposal/work plan and agreed to by CPM as a\nbasis for the contracted work.\n\n\n# NOTES:\n\n1\\. Unless otherwise noted, all movable furnishings and\nartwork are considered to be independent of the\narchitectural design project, but shall be coordinated as\npart of the budgeted project scope.\n\n2\\. Submittals of deliverables for contracted phases of\ndesign are to be preceded by a complete University\nreview and comments period consistent with the\nUniversity's prescribed process.\n\n3\\. All documents associated with a phase's submittal\nrequirements shall be in .pdf format.
